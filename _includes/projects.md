    <div class="project-title">GNN-based Filter for Missing Value Imputation</div>
    <div class="project-tools"><em>Tools used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Torch, Numpy, Deep Graph, Library (DGL), Optuna</em></div>
    <div class="project-desc">
      Developed a novel approach to handle missing data in multivariate time series without the need for initial imputation. The method transforms time series data into graph structures processed by an Edge-Featured Graph 
      Attention Network (EGAT), enabling simultaneous learning of temporal patterns and variable relationships. Integrated within a state-space model, the framework updates both node and edge features using the predicted 
      mean and covariance of the system state. Evaluated on benchmark datasets (ETTh1, ETTm1), the model demonstrated strong forecasting performance and robustness against missing values, pushing the boundaries of graph- 
      based time series modeling.

    <div class="project-title">Human Motion Synthesis</div>
    <div class="project-tools"><em>Tools used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, Numpy </em></div>
    <div class="project-desc">
      Designed a deep learning framework to predict short- and long-term human motion sequences across various activity classes. The architecture uses a two-stage autoencoder enhanced with self- and cross-attention 
      mechanisms to capture temporal dynamics, multi-scale dependencies, and motion smoothness. Integrated a motion classifier to enable action-switching forecasting based on semantic context. The model was trained and 
      evaluated on the Human3.6M dataset, achieving improved accuracy and motion realism compared to existing baselines‚Äîespecially in long-horizon predictions‚Äîthanks to effective pre-processing and attention-based 
      enhancements.

    <div class="project-title">Effective Knowledge-Based Word Sense Disambiguation</div>
    <div class="project-tools"><em>Tools used: Python, Word2Vec, SBERT, Flair, NLTK, Numpy</em></div>
    <div class="project-desc">
      Developed an enhanced version of the classical Lesk algorithm by leveraging semantic similarity from word and sentence embeddings (Word2Vec, SBERT, Flair) instead of word overlap. Evaluated the model on three 
      standard datasets ‚Äî SemCor 3.0, Senseval2, and Senseval3 ‚Äî achieving improved accuracy over traditional baseline methods. Explored variations by removing stopwords and testing multiple embedding strategies to 
      optimize performance.

    <div class="project-title">Movie Recommender System</div>
    <div class="project-tools"><em>Tools used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Scikit-learn</em></div>
    <div class="project-desc">
      Built a content-based movie recommender using the TMDB 5000 Movies dataset. Applied Natural Language Processing techniques to merge key metadata (overview, genres, cast, keywords) and transformed it using Bag of 
      Words with CountVectorizer. Calculated cosine similarity to return top 5 similar movie recommendations for a given title.

    <div class="project-tools"><em>Tools used: Python (Flask, OpenCV), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jinja2</em></div>
    <div class="project-desc">
      Developed a Flask-based web application that transforms user-uploaded images into realistic pencil sketches using OpenCV. The app allows users to preview and download the processed sketch, offering a seamless image 
      conversion experience through a clean UI.
